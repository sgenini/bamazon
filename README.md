In this activity, we'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills we learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, we can program our app to track product sales across our store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
